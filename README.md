# Automation Exercise Test Suite

This repository contains an automated test suite for [https://automationexercise.com](https://automationexercise.com) using Playwright with TypeScript, following industry best practices.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Best Practices

This test suite implements industry-standard practices for maintainable and scalable test automation:

### ‚úÖ **Page Object Model (POM)**
- **Actions in Page Objects**: All interactions (clicks, navigation, form filling) are encapsulated in page object methods
- **Validations in Tests**: All assertions and expectations remain in test files for clarity
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clean separation between test logic and page interactions

### üîß **Helper Methods & Utilities**
- **UserSetupHelper**: Centralized user data generation and management
- **Utils**: Common utility functions for data loading and browser interactions
- **Reusable Components**: Modular design for easy maintenance and updates

### üìã **Test Structure**
- **Test Steps**: Uses `test.step()` for clear test organization and better reporting
- **Atomic Tests**: Each test is independent and can run in isolation
- **Data-Driven**: External JSON files for test data management

### üõ°Ô∏è **Reliability Features**
- **Modal Management**: Automatic handling of blocking modals and popups
- **Wait Strategies**: Strategic waits for dynamic content and API responses
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging
- **Retry Logic**: Built-in retry mechanisms for flaky interactions

### üìä **Reporting & Debugging**
- **Allure Integration**: Enhanced reporting with test steps and attachments
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive console logging for debugging
- **Screenshots**: Automatic screenshots on failures
- **Test Artifacts**: Trace files and network logs for troubleshooting

## Test Case Independence

It is important to note that these test cases are designed to be **independent and atomic**. Each test script (`.spec.js` file) manages its own setup (including user registration if needed for the test) and, where appropriate, cleanup. You should be able to run individual test files or the entire suite in any order without tests failing due to dependencies on others.

The priority assigned in the table above refers to the functional importance and criticality of the test case for the application, not a required order of execution.

## Prerequisites

*   Node.js (version 16.x or higher recommended)
*   npm (usually comes with Node.js)
*   Git (for cloning the repository)

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This will install Playwright and other necessary packages defined in `package.json`.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install Playwright browsers:**
    This command installs the default browsers for Playwright (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit).
    ```bash
    npx playwright install
    ```

## Running Tests

Playwright tests can be executed using the `npx playwright test` command.

1.  **Run all tests:**
    This command will run all `.spec.js` files in the `tests` directory.
    ```bash
    npx playwright test
    ```

2.  **Run a specific test file:**
    ```bash
    npx playwright test tests/registerUser.spec.js
    ```

3.  **Run tests in headed mode (to watch the browser):**
    ```bash
    npx playwright test --headed
    ```
# Automation Exercise Test Suite

This repository contains an automated test suite for [https://automationexercise.com](https://automationexercise.com) using Playwright with JavaScript.

## Test Environment Configuration

This test suite supports multiple environments such as **development (dev)**, **quality assurance (qa)**, and **production (prod)**. The environment-specific settings are managed via the following files:

- `envConfig.ts`: Contains environment-specific variables such as base URLs, credentials, and other configuration values.
- `playwright.config.ts`: Configures Playwright test runner settings, including environment selection and test options.

### Selecting the Environment

You can specify the environment when running tests by setting an environment variable or passing a parameter, depending on your setup. For example:

```bash
# Run tests against the QA environment
set ENV=qa
npx playwright test

4.  **Run tests on a specific browser:**
    ```bash
    npx playwright test --browser=chromium
    # Other options: --browser=firefox, --browser=webkit, or --browser=all
    ```

# Run tests against the DEV environment (default)
### Test Execution

Tests can be executed using the `npx playwright test` command. By default, tests run in headless mode, but you can run in headed mode (to watch the browser) or in a specific browser using the `--headed` and `--browser` options, respectively.

### Test Reports

After test execution, a detailed HTML report is generated in the `playwright-report` directory. This report includes test results, screenshots, and other useful information.

### Viewing the Report

You can view the HTML report using the following command:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

This will open the report in your default web browser.

## Additional Configuration

### Browser Selection

By default, tests run in Chromium. You can specify a different browser using the `--browser` option. For example:

```bash
# Run tests in Firefox
npx playwright test
```

6.  **View HTML Report:**
    After running tests, an HTML report is typically generated in the `playwright-report` directory.
    ```bash
    npx playwright show-report
    ```

    ```

4.  **Verify TypeScript compilation:**
    ```bash
    npx tsc --noEmit
    ```

## üß™ Running Tests

Playwright tests can be executed using the `npx playwright test` command with various options:

### Basic Test Execution

1.  **Run all tests:**
    ```bash
    npx playwright test
    ```

2.  **Run a specific test file:**
    ```bash
    npx playwright test tests/registerUser.spec.ts
    npx playwright test tests/addProductsInCart.spec.ts
    ```

3.  **Run tests with specific pattern:**
    ```bash
    npx playwright test --grep "should add specified products"
    ```

### Development and Debugging

4.  **Run tests in headed mode (watch the browser):**
    ```bash
    npx playwright test --headed
    ```

5.  **Run tests on a specific browser:**
    ```bash
    npx playwright test --project=chromium
    npx playwright test --project=firefox
    npx playwright test --project=webkit
    ```

6.  **Debug tests with Playwright Inspector:**
    ```bash
    npx playwright test --debug
    ```

### Reporting and Analysis

7.  **Generate and view HTML report:**
    ```bash
    npx playwright test
    npx playwright show-report
    ```

8.  **Run tests with Allure reporting:**
    ```bash
    npm run test:allure
    npm run allure:serve
    ```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Continuous Integration

For CI/CD environments, use headless mode with specific output formats:

```bash
# CI-friendly execution
npx playwright test --reporter=github

# With custom configuration
npx playwright test --config=playwright.config.ci.ts
```

## üîß Test Environment Configuration

This test suite supports multiple environments:

### Environment Files
- `playwright.config.ts`: Main Playwright configuration
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript compilation settings
- `test-data/*.json`: Environment-specific test data

### Environment Selection
```bash
# Run tests against different environments
ENV=qa npx playwright test
ENV=staging npx playwright test
ENV=prod npx playwright test
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Modal Blocking Issues:**
   - The test suite includes automatic modal management
   - If tests fail due to blocking modals, check the console logs for modal state

2. **Element Not Found:**
   - Tests include robust wait strategies and retry logic
   - Check if selectors need updating for application changes

3. **TypeScript Compilation Errors:**
   ```bash
   # Check for TypeScript errors
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```

4. **Test Data Issues:**
   - Verify test data files in `test-data/` directory
   - Ensure data format matches TypeScript interfaces in `types/`

### Debugging Steps

1. **Run with detailed logging:**
   ```bash
   DEBUG=pw:api npx playwright test
   ```

2. **Run single test with trace:**
   ```bash
   npx playwright test --trace on tests/addProductsInCart.spec.ts
   ```

3. **View trace files:**
   ```bash
   npx playwright show-trace test-results/trace.zip
   ```

## üìà Reporting

### HTML Reports
- Generated automatically after test runs
- Located in `playwright-report/` directory
- View with `npx playwright show-report`

### Allure Reports
- Enhanced reporting with test steps and attachments
- Setup: `npm install -g allure-commandline`
- Generate: `npm run allure:generate`
- Serve: `npm run allure:serve`

### Console Logging
- Detailed execution logs for debugging
- Product addition confirmations
- Modal state management logs
- Error context and troubleshooting information

## üîÑ Test Independence

All test cases are designed to be **independent and atomic**:

- ‚úÖ Each test manages its own setup and cleanup
- ‚úÖ Tests can run in any order without dependencies
- ‚úÖ User data is generated uniquely for each test run
- ‚úÖ Account cleanup ensures no test data pollution

## üèóÔ∏è Extending the Test Suite

### Adding New Tests
1. Create new `.spec.ts` file in `tests/` directory
2. Follow existing patterns for test structure and steps
3. Use helper methods and page objects for consistency

### Adding New Page Objects
1. Create new `.ts` file in `pages/` directory
2. Implement locators and action methods
3. Keep validations in test files, actions in page objects

### Adding Test Data
1. Add data to appropriate `.json` file in `test-data/`
2. Update TypeScript interfaces in `types/`
3. Use `Utils.loadTestData()` to access data in tests
